## Data

I use the data recorded from DATAUSA (https://datausa.io/), an open-source data website for public. I found the average wage, median property value (living cost), healthcare insured rate/number (healthcare), and food danger (living quality) to be independent variables for Immigration number, the dependent variables.

Here is the summary of the dataset I am using in this analysis.

```{r}
summary(data)

```

To make it clear, my dataset includes 52 observables (50 states plus District of Columbia and Puerto Rico) in 12 attributes. The relevant variables are: 

- average wage (AveWage)

- property value(PropertyValue)

- health insurance coverage(Insured)

- food Risk (FoodDanger)

The dependent variable is coded as Immigration, which refers to the population of immigrants.

*Note: all the variables are numeric expect for FoodDanger. The original data is in a percentage form, which means the percentage of unsafe food. Due to the small variance of original data, I convert this variable into a factor variable. Those states with a percentage over 15 (the mean), they are labeled as "high", otherwise, "low".

## Methods and Hypothesis

For methods chosen to analyze the dataset, basically, regressions are used in my project, including both simple linear regression and multiple regressions.

My general null hypothesis is $\mu_0$: average wage, property value, health insurance coverage and food risk all have influences on preferences of immigrants. In particular:

$\mu_a$: Health insurance is relatively the most influential factor.

$\mu_b$: Income level is more important for immigrants comparing with property value.

$\mu_c$: People are more likely to stay in a state with lower food risks.
